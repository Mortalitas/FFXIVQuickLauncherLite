# FFXIVQuickLauncherLite [![Discord Shield](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/465931452085829643/widget.png?style=shield)](https://discord.gg/39WpvU2)

A fast launcher for Final Fantasy XIV forked from [goaaats' FFXIVQuickLauncher](https://github.com/goaaats/FFXIVQuickLauncher).

## Why?

The original FFXIV launcher is slow, tedious, kinda ugly and cannot save your password. While the original [FFXIVQuickLauncher](https://github.com/goaaats/FFXIVQuickLauncher) project aims to fix that while adding QoL features, this fork is a heavily trimmed down version without any extra tools or QoL improvements outside of password saving, automatic login, and Steam integration.

## How to install

[Download the latest release from the releases](https://github.com/Mortalitas/FFXIVQuickLauncherLite/releases/latest) page, unzip it into any folder you can easily access it and launch XIVLauncherLite.exe - then just follow the instructions!
